Project for a vehicle in 2D space to achieve self locomotion. This project implements Reinforcement Learning as a means to achieve self driving. 
The user can make obstacles using a paint-like interface. This enhances the challenge for the reinforcement learning model.

The user will also get the ability to save the trained model.
